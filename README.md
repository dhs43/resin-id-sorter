# Resin Identification Code (RIC) Sorter
# Android app using Google Machine Learning and Vision APIs to identify recycling codes

App uses a set of approximately 500 photos of RICs. Users can, with varying success, scan these codes and be directed to information regarding the correct recycling procedure. This was mostly to learn how to use Google's Machine Learning and Vision APIs. It would be most useful in Europe where RICs are more common.

The next-step for usability would be to collect a larger dataset to better train the model.
